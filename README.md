# roman-numeral-c

There's a bunch left to do on this kata. I have not handled invalid characters. I'm also a bit sloppy with memory management. There's a duplicated patterns in both of the main conversion methods. I intend to fix that duplication and templatize (macro-ize?) a more compact solution.

There are edge cases around buffers, upper bounds and lower bounds that still need to be handled.

Having said all that, you should be able to clone the repo and type 'make' at the command line. This will compile, link and run the tests.
